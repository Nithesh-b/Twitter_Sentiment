Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This project contains the code to execute the programs for analysing Twitter Sentiment Analysis.


The code is written to be executed in Google Colab. 

1)Please do upload the Base_tweets_DataSetV3.xlsx onto the ‘sample_data’ directory.

2)Also, create a folder called ‘outputs’ under ‘sample_data’ directory.

3) For subsequent ipynb files, the ‘outputs’ directory needs to be created in ‘sample_data’ path and corresponding files have to be imported.

4)Key point to observe is that the algorithms takes more than 30 minutes to complete the training and ensure to keep the Colab session active.

5)The programs can also be run on the local machine provided the packages are installed and the path is changed accordingly.

6)The code is available in ‘code’ directory.

7)The outputs are available in ‘output’ directory

8)The input dataset with the name ‘Base_tweets_DataSetV3.xlsx’ is available in the root directory.
